Basic image-based machine learning models. 
Use of ensemble methods: Random Forest, Gradient Boosting Classifier, and Support Vector Machine. 
File 1.2 supports the use of a Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG). 
Sets to gray scale. Uses median intensity, mean intensity, max intensity, signal area,  and standard deviation intensity.
Provides confidence/accuracy scores. 
1.4 is currently the most updated version of the model. Other 1.4s do involve very similar functions but have different outputs depending on the task created for them.
